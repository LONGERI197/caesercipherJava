## CAESAR CIPHER PROJECT
The 1st Java assignment trial
#### By Lilian Bisase Ongeri

### Project Description.
The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that was first used by Julius Caesar. It works by shifting each letter of the alphabet by a certain number of positions. For example, if the shift is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on.

## Project Set Up Instructions
* Clone the Repository in your IDE. (git@github.com:LONGERI197/caesercipherJava.git)
* Install all dependencies to continue

## BDD
Using a key, which is an integer between 1 and 25, This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".

### Technologies Used
* Intellij IDEA
* Gradle

### Link to live site on GitHub Pages
 Once the frontend is built and app is hosted it will be shared.
